I’m great at knowing the right algorithm for a problem because I read computer science literature constantly.
Algorithms problems are to me like chess is to my grandfather.
I love working with people to do things bigger than I could accomplish alone.
I’m motivated by big problems, and I think you’ve got some here that I can help solve.
